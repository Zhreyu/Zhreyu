Hi. My name is Shreyas, and I’m currently pursuing my M.Tech in Computer Science while working as a student researcher @ Emory BMI, focusing on EEG data modeling and computational neuroscience. Previously, I had experience in optimizing data pipelines and developing scalable AI-driven solutions for research initiatives. Over the past couple of years, I’ve contributed to applied research in large-scale neural models, particularly in healthcare and NLP applications. My background also includes work in distributed systems and transformer architectures, refining their efficiency across projects.
